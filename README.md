# Project README

## Overview
This repository contains the Jupyter Notebook file for the Pirate Intelligent Agent project. The project focuses on applying key concepts of reinforcement learning and neural networks to solve a real-world problem such as pathfinding.

## Project Description
In this project, we were given a base code that included the implementation of a treasure maze environment, a game experience module, and a basic Q-learning algorithm using a neural network model. The code allowed an intelligent agent, represented by a pirate, to navigate through a maze and find the treasure. Our task was to enhance the existing code and improve the agent's performance in finding the optimal path.

To accomplish this, we made several modifications and additions to the code. We added functions to visualize the maze, designed a mechanism to check the completion of the maze, and introduced an exploration factor to balance exploration and exploitation in the agent's decision-making process. Additionally, we trained a deep Q-learning model using neural networks to improve the agent's learning and decision-making capabilities.

## Reflection and Learning
Throughout this course, we've gained valuable insights into the field of computer science and its broader applications. We've connected our learning to various aspects of computer science, including algorithms, reinforcement learning, and neural networks.

As computer scientists, our role is to solve complex problems and create efficient and effective solutions using computational tools and techniques. We analyze problems, design algorithms, write code, and use mathematical models to develop software and systems that address real-world challenges. Computer science matters because it drives innovation, enables technological advancements, and empowers us to create solutions that improve other various aspects of our lives!

When approaching a problem as a computer scientist, we follow a systematic or iterative approach. We first understand the problem, define the requirements and constraints, and identify the key objectives or goals. Then, we break down the problem into smaller components, analyze the available data, and design algorithms or models to solve the problem. We iteratively implement, test, and refine our solutions to ensure they meet the desired criteria.

As computer scientists, we also have ethical responsibilities to both end users and organizations. We must consider the potential impact of our solutions on individuals, society, and the environment. We strive to develop solutions that are fair, inclusive, and respect privacy and security. We should also be mindful of biases and ethical implications in data collection, model training, and decision-making processes. By prioritizing ethical considerations, we can contribute to the development of responsible and beneficial technology.
